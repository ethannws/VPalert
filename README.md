# Vacancy Poster Alert System

## üìå Overview
This script retrieves subscription data from the Vacancy Poster API and sends email alerts to branches and an overall admin if any subscriptions have fewer than **10 credits** remaining.

## ‚ú® Features
‚úÖ Fetches subscription data from the Vacancy Poster API.  
‚úÖ Filters out subscriptions marked as **"NOT USING"**.  
‚úÖ Matches subscription names to predefined branches.  
‚úÖ Sends **individual low-credit alerts** to branch-specific email addresses.  
‚úÖ Sends an **overall report** to an admin email.  
‚úÖ Allows **anonymous SMTP relay** for email sending.  

## üõ† Configuration
### `config.json` Example:
```json
{
  "api_accounts": [
    {"email": "user1@example.com", "password": "password1"},
    {"email": "user2@example.com", "password": "password2"}
  ],
  "smtp_server": "smtp.example.com",
  "smtp_port": 25,
  "sender_email": "alerts@example.com",
  "sender_password": "",
  "branch_emails": {
    "Thorne": "thorne@example.com",
    "Wait": "wait@example.com",
    "BranchA": "brancha@example.com",
    "BranchB": "branchb@example.com"
  },
  "overall_report_email": "admin@example.com"
}
```

## üöÄ How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ The script retrieves subscription data for each `api_accounts` entry.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ It cleans the data and extracts relevant subscription details.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ If a subscription has **fewer than 10 credits** and matches a branch, it is logged for that branch.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Emails are sent:**  
   - **Branch-specific emails**: Lists low-credit subscriptions for that branch.  
   - **Admin report**: Lists all low-credit subscriptions across all branches.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Emails include a request to **contact support** if credits need to be added or to opt out of reminders for unused job boards.  

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Script
1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure **Python** is installed.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script:
   ```sh
   python script.py
   ```

## üìß Email Message Format
### **Branch-Specific Alerts:**
```plaintext
Subject: Vacancy Poster Low Credit Alert - [Branch Name]

The following subscriptions for [Branch Name] have less than 10 credits remaining:
- [Subscription Name] - [Remaining Credits]

Please email Support with the amount of credits if any you would like added.
Additionally, if you do not use any job boards listed, please let Support know so we can prevent further reminders for those boards. Thank you.
```

### **Overall Report to Admin:**
```plaintext
Subject: Vacancy Poster Overall Low Credit Alert

The following subscriptions across all branches have less than 10 credits remaining:
- [Subscription Name] - [Remaining Credits]
```

## üîç Notes
- Ensure that the **SMTP server allows anonymous email relay** if using port 25 without authentication.  
- Verify that the `branch_emails` list covers all expected branch names to **avoid missing alerts**.
